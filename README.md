# CARRE Mobile
CARRE Mobile is an health application which uses a user's data in the form of Personal Health Records (PHR) in order to calculate his/her health risks and advise him so that he can prevent or mitigate a disease that is about to happen. It is designed and coded for Android devices and uses CARRE's database to cross-reference a user's data.

## Getting Started
This project is available as source code and a standalone application. The code can be downloaded using the usual Git tools or by downloading as zip through the website.

### Prequisites
A potential user needs a device with Android at least 4.4 KitKat version installed.

### Installation
In order to install the application, a user needs just to:
* Download the carre_mobile.apk file.
* Move/Copy the application in his/her smartphone.
* In his/her smartphone's settings, enable the Unknown Sources setting.
* With the help of a file manager, find the file and install it.

### Usage
The app is currently only available when having internet connection.
First tab has general information about the database, second tab contains the user's personal data, third tab displays information about the risks that occur and the last tab is where the advisor is located. During the first run the user needs to insert his personal data and then restart the application in order for the interface to renew itself.
